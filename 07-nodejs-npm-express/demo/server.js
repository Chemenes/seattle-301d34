// Load the express library from node_modules
// Returns a function reference

// Instantiate express so we can use its functionality
// Now the constant variable "app" is an object and we can use its methods
// We are going to use methods for routing HTTP requests, which come from the view

// Designate a port to serve our app on
// "process" is in the Node environment, use a port if it is set up, or set your own

// To set up your own PORT in your terminal type: export PORT=3000

// Tell the server which directory to serve files from

// Set up a route to send a message

// Set up a route to send a file
// Include the root for relative file paths

// Can we perform other methods on the same route?

// Start the app so it listens for changes
